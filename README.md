# Flood Detection with Satellite Images Using Deep Learning

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, and early detection is critical for minimizing damage. This project presents an advanced deep learning-based flood detection system that processes satellite imagery in real time to identify flooded areas with high precision.

# Overview of the Project

Our model utilizes a U-Net architecture enhanced with Attention Mechanisms for efficient and accurate image segmentation. Unlike traditional clustering-based approaches (like K-Means), our model directly learns to identify flood regions using pixel-level classification, significantly improving accuracy and computational efficiency.

To fine-tune the model, we integrated Keras Tuner for automated hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, the model is trained using extensive data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, shifting) to improve generalization across varied environmental conditions and satellite datasets.

#  Comparison to Existing Systems

Existing systems rely on hybrid CNN + ResNet models with clustering-based segmentation and complex optimization algorithms (e.g., CHHSSO).

Our system avoids clustering and vegetation indices, reducing complexity and improving adaptability across different geographies.
